          <h1>Ruckus Wireless - Support Redesign</h1>
          <h2>Mock-ups for Various Support Site Pages</h2>
          <p>In order to add new functionality and provide a better customer experience, the Ruckus Wireless <a href="https://support.ruckuswireless.com">Support</a> site needed to be refreshed. I worked closely with our other designer and the Support site team to incorporate new features into a more refined interface. This was no small task - the Support site was split into many important tools and resources. The homepage in particular was challenging as there are many elements competing for attention.</p>
          <p>The mock-ups seen here were close to what was launched for the new website. Most of the site was written in Ruby, and I enjoyed the opportunity to learn bits of a new language when I was assisting with implementation.</p>
