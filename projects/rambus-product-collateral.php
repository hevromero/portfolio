            <figcaption>Examples of two Rambus product briefs. There were over 60 of these to maintain, and they drilled deeper into the Rambus product portfolio. Before my time with Rambus concluded, I created a brand-new futureproof template that could be more easily converted between letter and A4, potentially saving hours of work that would be required to create and maintain two separate templates.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>An example of a white paper authored for Rambus. While these were created far less frequently, they are chalk-full of important information that needed to be clear, with simple but effective imagery. <a href="/projects/graphic-design/rambus-white-paper.pdf">See a full white paper example.</a></figcaption>

            <figcaption>I designed many visually-interesting ebooks as part of my design duties at Rambus. With over a dozen ebooks, our refined template system made it straightforward to meet rapid-fire requests. One product launch required the creation of two ebooks within days.</figcaption>

          <h1>Product Collateral </h1>
          <h2>Web and Print</h2>
          <p>During my time as a Graphic Design Specialist at Rambus, I was accountable for the majority of day-to-day design tasks for the Marketing team. I maintained a library of over 100 documents including product briefs, solution overviews, ebooks and white papers.</p> 
          <p>Product collateral tasks often appeared without warning, and sometimes needed to be turned around within a single day. Thankfully our system of creating InDesign drafts, firing off emails, and pinning up physical copies worked well. We were highly successful at hitting these unforgiving deadlines.</p>
          <p>I redesigned the standard templates for ebooks and white papers with an emphasis on utility and consistency. I also crafted templates for product briefs and solution overviews to the team's Creative Design Manager, with these same goals in mind.</p>
